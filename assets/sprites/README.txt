This directory should contain the following sprite files:

1. character.png - A sprite sheet for the character animations with:
   - Walking frames (frames 0-7)
   - Idle frames (frames 8-11)
   - Jump frames (frames 12-14)

The actual sprite files need to be added to make the game fully functional with animations.
For now, this serves as a placeholder to inform about the required assets.
